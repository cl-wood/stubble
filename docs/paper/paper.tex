\section{Fuzzing Overview}

white/black/graybox, mutation/generation, Dynamic Taint Analysis, 


As programs grow larger, so do the test suites designed to exercise execution paths within the program. White box approaches have the advantage of source code, allowing developers to write test cases which exercise paths in a higher level language. With black box approaches, however, test cases would typically target assembly block-level code paths [A,...NEEDED].

\subsection{Dynamic Taint Analysis}

Dynamic taint analysis (DTA) is the process of locating sources of taint and following their propagation through a binary to data sinks. Since, for exploitation, bugs must be triggered by user input, DTA usually identifies all user input (files, command line arguments, UI interactions, ...) as tainted, and marks it accordingly.

The granularity of taint marking is variable. Assigning everything from a generic binary value of tainted/not tainted to bit-level marking of which part of user input affected which variable is conceivable, although finer-grained taint analysis is more computationally expensive and difficult to determine [CITE]. Consider the following pseudocode:
\begin{verbatim} 
x = userInput & 1
if x % 2 == 0:
	vuln()				
\end{verbatim}

TODO
Taint can propagate via explicit or implicit flows (Figure 1). Explicit flows involve a tainted variable, x, which is used in an assignment expression to compute a new variable, y. In this situation, x taints y, and if y is involved in any further assignment to a variable z, then x taints z by transitivity. In contrast, implicit data flows ... [D]. 

Because of subtle implicit flow cases referenced by Clause, J. et all [D], which can be difficult to spot (Page 2, Figure 2b). Implicit data flows are not always considered by dynamic tainting techniques [E].

\begin{verbatim}
# Explicit taint

# Implicit taint
\end{verbatim}
